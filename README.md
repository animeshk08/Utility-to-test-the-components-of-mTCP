# Utility-to-test-the-components-of-mTCP
This project aims at making a utility to test the components of mTCP such as TCP congestion control algorithms, ECN, etc. using network namespaces and VMs.

## Description about the included directories 
The directories include the steps to setup mTCP and run epserver and epwget, mTCP-epoll based applications. Along with this, the screenshots of the output are also included.

### Directories : 
 
 1.2vm : Applications run on two different VMs, with epserver on one VM and epwget on the other VM.
 2. onvm : Using OpenNetVM, a NFV( Network Function Virtualization), the  2 applications were run on the same VM using the ports generated by the ONVM.
